To add a new AI tool, create a new entry in the `lib/tools.tsx` file. Example:
    ```tsx
    {
        slug: "podcast-guest-researcher", // the slug that, when clicked on, will open your tool on, for example: https://your_website/podcast-guest-researcher

        icon: "üîç", // icon of the tool for visuals

        title: "Podcast Guest Researcher", // title of the tool

        description: "Streamlines the process of researching podcast guests", // description of the tool

        category: "", // optional, can categorize your tools

        workflowID: "669b2c0364d31ec6f5ec0361", // the ID of the workflow on MindPal, can be viewed when sharing the link, it is the ID after `https://workflow.mindpal.space/669b2c0364d31ec6f5ec0361` 

        copywriting: "The Podcast Guest Researcher is an innovative tool designed to enhance your podcasting experience by streamlining the preparation process for interviews. This tool empowers hosts to create compelling episodes that captivate audiences through its array of powerful features.", // A more detailed introduction to your tools, so you can share it with others
    }, 
    ```

2. Customize the appearance and functionality of your AI hub through the `app/globals.css` directory.
